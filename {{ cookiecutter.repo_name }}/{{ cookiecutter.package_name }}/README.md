# Structure

With this structure, the `DataScienceHelper` class in `main.py` orchestrates the overall data science pipeline, while the specific implementations of data loading, transformation, modeling, evaluation, and experiment tracking are separated into their respective modules and files. This separation of concerns promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability.

* `data/preprocessing` and `data/feature_engineering` are submodules of the data module, containing utilities for preprocessing and feature engineering tasks, respectively.
* `data/data_splitting` is a submodule for functions related to splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

### Optional Submodules to add

* `modeling/model_selection` and `modeling/hyperparameter_tuning` are submodules of the `models` module, containing utilities for model selection and hyperparameter tuning, respectively.
* `evaluation/interpretability` is a submodule of the `evaluation` module, with functions for model interpretability and explanation.
* `experiments/pipelines` is a submodule of the experiments module, containing classes or functions for creating end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
* `deployment` is a new top-level module for functions related to model deployment.
* `config.py` is a top-level module for managing project configuration settings.

In addition to the modules we've already discussed (data loading, data transformation, modeling, evaluation, and experiment tracking), here are some other common modules that could be useful to add to a comprehensive data science helper class:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:

`preprocessing.py`: This module can include functions for handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and other common data preprocessing tasks.


### 2. Feature Engineering:

`feature_engineering.py`: This module can contain functions for creating new features from existing ones, such as polynomial features, interaction features, or domain-specific feature transformations.


### 3. Data Splitting:

`data_splitting.py`: This module can provide functions for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets, as well as methods for stratified splitting or cross-validation.


### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning:

`hyperparameter_tuning.py`: This module can include functions or classes for performing hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.


### 5. Model Selection:

`model_selection.py`: This module can provide functions or classes for model selection techniques, such as ensemble methods (e.g., bagging, boosting, stacking), or model evaluation strategies like cross-validation.


### 6. Interpretability:

`interpretability.py`: This module can contain functions for interpreting and explaining machine learning models, such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, or model-agnostic techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).


### 7. Deployment:

`deployment.py`: This module can include functions or classes for deploying trained models to production environments, such as serializing models, creating API endpoints, or containerizing models for deployment.


### 8. Utilities:

`utils.py`: This module can contain general utility functions that are used across multiple other modules, such as functions for handling file paths, logging, or data visualization.


### 9. Pipelines:

`pipelines.py`: This module can provide classes or functions for creating and managing end-to-end machine learning pipelines, combining data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps into a single workflow.


### 10. Configuration:

`config.py`: This module can manage and store configuration settings for the data science project, such as file paths, hyperparameters, or other project-specific settings.
