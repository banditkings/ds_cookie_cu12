# ds_cookie

A Python data science [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for a `poetry` and `pyenv` user, which includes:

1. A `src` folder where the main module for shared code should exist in `src/package_name`
2. pre-commit hooks:
   1. `autopep8`
   2. `poetry export` to sync dependencies with a requirements.txt file
3. A local `.python-version` for `pyenv`
4. Folder structure similar to `kedro`

## Usage

To create a new project folder that follows this cookiecutter template run:  

```
python -m cookiecutter git@github.com:banditkings/ds_cookie.git
```

or if using HTTPS auth:

```
python -m cookiecutter https://github.com/banditkings/ds_cookie.git
```
